# material-synthwave-super-semantic README

A theme that aims to provide fine-grained semantic distinctions while being easy-on-the-eyes with a warm-leaning color palette WHILE ALSO remaining colorful and enjoyable to look at. Does it succeed? ehhhhhhh... it can vary. But it does generally help with breaking down big dense repos or learning a new language by organizing the tokens into some pretty fine-grained categories. Originally based off of the material synthwave theme, with influence from the Palenight and OneDark themes. Uses both Textmate and Semantic token scopes.
