# Change Log

## [Released-Beta]
The theme is still not what I would call "finished" even though it has more total features than most themes. I anticipate somewhat significant evolutions to continue, though from here on, all major distinct versions will be kept live.
- 0.5.5: added support for makefile recipes and prerequisites, expanded Go semantic token coverage
- 0.5.1: Fixed a bug with Go imports not being colored correctly with semantic tokens.
- 0.5.0: Public Release! Added theme elements for bracket pairs, outline symbols, menus, errors, and matching colors for errorLens, among other consistency tweaks.
- Initial release --------------------
- 0.4.0: More specific coverage added for Go and Rust Semantic tokens and language nuances. Switched to a dark and uniform base background
- 0.3.0: Color overhaul for strings, objects, and strings (just for code - ui is NOT matching the changes at this time). The colors were made less intense and very slightly more faded. Also, walked-back the rust-colors for namespaces. They now match the objects/classes/interfaces/structs in color, but remain underlined as a quick distinction.
- 0.2.0: Updated the special keyword operators ( arrows(->, =>), assignment(=), new, reference(&) ) to be non-italic for less overall italics in the theme. Also reduced the saturation of their purple color.
