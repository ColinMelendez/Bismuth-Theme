## [Unreleased]

- Initial release --------------------
- 0.3.0: Color overhaul for strings, objects, and strings (just for code - ui is NOT matching the changes at this time). The colors were made less intense and very slightly more faded. Also, walked-back the rust-colors for namespaces. They now match the objects/classes/interfaces/structs in color, but remain underlined as a quick distinction.
- 0.2.3: Updated the special keyword operators ( arrows(->, =>), assignment(=), new, reference(&) ) to be non-italic for less overall italics in the theme. Also reduced the saturation of their purple color.
